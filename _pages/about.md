## Working Papers 

### Who calls the shots? How financial incentives impact the adoption of a new health technology
Job Market Paper

In healthcare, the decision to adopt a product is a joint problem between the healthcare professional and the patient. At the same time, subsidies and incentive programs in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) have become an important policy tool to increase the adoption of new health technologies. Using data from a randomized control trial (RCT) in Kenya, this paper employs a structural model of patient demand and provider counseling to study the welfare effects to the patient from the introduction of demand and supply side subsidies for a new contraceptive technology. The experimental variation and structural model allow to study the channels that lead to the diffusion of the new health technology, including the role of provider counseling, provider financial incentives and altruism, and patient’s preferences. Taken together, the results suggest that the provider's counseling role is key in increasing adoption of the new technology and making subsidy programs successful, regardless of whether the subsidies target the patient or the provider.

### Targeting Impact versus Deprivation
With [Johannes Haushofer](https://haushofer.ne.su.se/), [Edward Miguel](https://emiguel.econ.berkeley.edu/), [Michael Walker](https://www.michaelwwalker.me/) and [Paul Niehaus](https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~pniehaus/)  

[Conditional accept, American Economic Review](https://econweb.ucsd.edu/~pniehaus/papers/targeting_impact_deprivation.pdf)

A large literature has examined how best to target anti-poverty programs to those most deprived in some sense (e.g., consumption). We examine the potential tradeoff between this objective and targeting those most impacted by such programs. We work in the context of an NGO cash transfer program in Kenya, employing recent advances in machine learning methods and dynamic outcome data to learn proxy means tests that jointly target both objectives. Targeting solely on the basis of deprivation is not attractive in this setting under standard social welfare criteria unless the planner’s preferences are extremely redistributive.

### Increasing access to contraceptive choice through targeted incentives
With [Maria Dieci](https://mariadieci.com/) and [Paul Gertler](https://www.paulgertler.com/)  

We investigate how targeted subsidies for long-acting injectable contraception and provider incentives impact initial uptake, sustained adoption, pricing and stocking decisions for contraceptive products in local markets, sales, and user health outcomes. Following prior work on the effectiveness of subsidies to promote the adoption of new technologies and experience goods, we aim to test if subsidies lead to sustained adoption of injectable contraception as well as to study possible mechanisms for continued usage (or lack of) such as learning, price anchoring, and information effects. We propose a market-level cluster randomized controlled trial in 140 pharmacies in Kenya to answer these questions. Patient subsidies and pharmacist incentives will be cross-randomized and compared against the status quo to evaluate their effectiveness in promoting sustained adoption.
