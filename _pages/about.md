## Working Papers 

### Who calls the shots? Financial incentives and provider influence in the adoption of a new health technology
[Job Market Paper](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/jcqkmiv257wh6r3xjai8g/AHjbglr6ZG9fpeTdnvhhYwI?rlkey=qo6ptijlxi13mqaj003hihcb7&st=5ywzzvwc&dl=0)

The choice to adopt an effective healthcare product is often a joint decision between the patient and their medical professional. Many governments and payers use patient subsidies and provider incentives to increase the adoption of new health technologies. Using data from a randomized field experiment in Kenya, I estimate a structural model of patient demand and provider advice for a new contraceptive method. I then use the model to study the welfare effects to the patient from the introduction of demand and supply side incentives to adopt the new technology. This approach allows the study of channels that promote diffusion, including the roles of provider advice, financial incentives and altruism, as well as patient preferences. Taken together, the results suggest that changes in provider advice due to their altruism and financial incentives are key to increasing adoption of the new technology and making incentive programs effective, regardless of whether the incentive targets the patient or the provider. In fact, changes in provider advice account for 79% of the welfare benefits of a policy that reduces the price to the patient. To be effective, incentive policies need to account for the central role that the provider takes in medical decision-making.

### Using Diagnosis Contingent Incentive Contracts to Improve Malaria Treatment

<summary> <b> Abstract </b> <\summary>
We examine whether a diagnosis contingent incentive contract structure improves the treatment of malaria, and whether it's best to target those incentives to patients or providers. The contract provides incentives to use rapid tests (RDTs) to diagnose patient malaria status combined with incentives to treat with antimalarial drugs (ACTs) if the patient tests positive but not if test negative. Using data from a cluster randomized field experiment with 140 pharmacies in malaria endemic regions of Kenya, we find that both patient subsidies and provider incentives significantly increased RDT testing uptake.  Absent incentives, 87% of suspected malaria patients purchase ACTs, of which as many as 90\% are doing so unnecessarily because they do not have malaria. Across all arms, the incentives lead to an increase RDT test use by 25 pp and a 14 pp decline in the purchase of ACTs. The effects are stronger for patient incentives than for provider incentives. Patient incentives are translated into lower prices whereas provider incentives work through information and advice. Using a model of patient choice, we estimate that diagnosis-contingent contracts increase social welfare substantially relative to program costs, with a rate of return of at least 50% across all contract types being tested. The primary gain in welfare comes from a reduction in the use of ACTs from patients who test negative and therefore do not need treatment.

<summary> <b> Abstract </b> <\summary>
A large literature has examined how best to target anti-poverty programs to those most deprived in some sense (e.g., consumption). We examine the potential tradeoff between this objective and targeting those most impacted by such programs. We work in the context of an NGO cash transfer program in Kenya, employing recent advances in machine learning methods and dynamic outcome data to learn proxy means tests that jointly target both objectives. Targeting solely on the basis of deprivation is not attractive in this setting under standard social welfare criteria unless the planner’s preferences are extremely redistributive.

### Increasing access to contraceptive choice through targeted incentives
With [Maria Dieci](https://mariadieci.com/) and [Paul Gertler](https://www.paulgertler.com/)  

We investigate how targeted subsidies for long-acting injectable contraception and provider incentives impact initial uptake, sustained adoption, pricing and stocking decisions for contraceptive products in local markets, sales, and user health outcomes. Following prior work on the effectiveness of subsidies to promote the adoption of new technologies and experience goods, we aim to test if subsidies lead to sustained adoption of injectable contraception as well as to study possible mechanisms for continued usage (or lack of) such as learning, price anchoring, and information effects. We propose a market-level cluster randomized controlled trial in 140 pharmacies in Kenya to answer these questions. Patient subsidies and pharmacist incentives will be cross-randomized and compared against the status quo to evaluate their effectiveness in promoting sustained adoption.
